# Explanatory models in neonatology (Explain)

<b>Introduction</b> <br>
Critically ill patients are fragile, and their physiology is complex and frequently only partially understood. Diagnostic reasoning, clinical decision making, and communication between members of the healthcare team often take place under time pressure. Mathematical models of human physiology can support the understanding of a range of conditions, but remain inaccessible to most clinicians due to a lack of mathematical and/or code reading skills. The use of these models in reasoning and decision making is even more challenging than their use in understanding conditions. To overcome these obstacles we propose to use the concept and method of explanatory models, first described in the medical educational context (1). Our initial focus will be on deeper understanding of, and reasoning about, cardiorespiratory (patho)physiology by academic researchers in a neonatal intensive care setting. The explanatory model for this purpose will be referred to as "Explain".  Our ultimate objective remains support of clinical decision making. 

This github repository contains all the python code of the Explain model
